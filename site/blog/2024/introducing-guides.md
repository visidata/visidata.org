VisiData is an incredibly powerful tool, often hailed as "world-class" and ["the gold standard"](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38894276) for data exploration.

However, these accolades usually come with a caveat: it has "a steep learning curve".

Over the years, as we've invested in ease of use, we've amassed a wide range of documentation sources [^1]:

- Command helpstrings (seen on the Help Sheet with `z Ctrl+H`).
- Option helpstrings (seen on the Options Sheet with `Shift+O`).
- Python docstrings for [API docs](https://visidata.org/docs/api).
- [General documentation at /docs](https://visidata.org/docs).
- [UNIX manpage](https://visidata.org/man).
- [Blog posts here on visidata.org](https://visidata.org/blog).
- Github [Issues](https://github.com/saulpw/visidata/issues) and [Discussions](https://github.com/saulpw/visidata/discussions) on the [main repository](https://github.com/saulpw/visidata/).
- [Saul's YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@saulpw).
- External resources like [Andrea Borruso's tutorial](https://ondata.github.io/guidaVisiData/) and [Jeremy Singer-Vine's cheatsheet](https://jsvine.github.io/visidata-cheat-sheet/en/).
- [Development team documentation at /dev](https://github.com/saulpw/visidata/tree/develop/dev).

We also have some non-documentation sources, like:

- [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@saulpw) for bonus tips and trivia and related projects.
- [Patreon](https://patreon.com/saulpw) for updates and data games and text art, with various support tiers.
- [Saulville](https://visidata.org/chat) (Discord server) and occasional office hours, for community interaction.

## Whew, that's a lot!

And we know that quantity sometimes makes it harder to know where to find what's relevant to you.  So we've been steadily shifting our approach to usability, to make it easier to find what you need within VisiData itself.  For example:

- (added in 2.6) a [menu system](https://youtu.be/QixtGeSbSLU?si=2Cd5TuZUiIGEfTwO) so you can browse for commands.
- (added in 3.0) a [command palette](https://github.com/saulpw/visidata/pull/2059) so you can fuzzy search for commands.
- (added in 3.0) [sidebar help](https://github.com/saulpw/visidata/discussions/1733) so you can get more context-aware information.

Finally, building on the sidebar context-sensitive help that's been added in 3.0, we're starting to add **Guides**.

## Guides are Organized Explanations of Features

Each guide is a highlight of a particular feature, giving a basic synoposis and including 5-15 related commands and options. Like the manpage, they are viewable from within VisiData itself. You should not have to leave the terminal to learn how to use VisiData.

A few of these guides have already been written! To explore the existing guides, open the **Guide Index** with `Space open-guide-index` (within VisiData) or `vd -P open-guide-index` (from the CLI).

White text indicates a written guide; gray guides haven't been written, yet. Press `Enter` on a written guide to take a look!

Particularly exciting is the [support for basic markdown VisiData's own display attribute syntax](https://www.visidata.org/docs/api/guides#some-stylings-of-note). This is how the colors in the guides were added.

We can even add links!

We think that most of VisiData's 300+ commands and 150 options can be represented in ~30 guides. So not only will the guides cover a breadth of features in more depth, they will also act as a structured command reference. These guides will eventually supplant the existing web content and existing manpage--both should be composable from the guides.

## When will more guides be published?

This is where you can come in! For v3.1, we are planning to host a documentation drive, encouraging contributions from the community. If you are interested in helping out, check out the **Guide Index** and consider which topics you would like to write guides for. We have a [tutorial up on adding a guide](https://www.visidata.org/docs/api/guides) and are welcoming PRs. Another blogpost will be out soon with more info.

[^1]: There are also several 'nonsources', including the GitHub wiki, Twitter @VisiData, r/visidata subreddit, StackOverflow, and an ancient fork on readthedocs.
    These are deprecated, neither maintained nor monitored, and will be removed if possible once any content has been preserved in a more active documentation form.
