## Join the Documentation Drive for VisiData!

So how does [adding something new](https://xkcd.com/927/) help us solve our documentation challenges? Hear me out: VisiData's documentation is evolving, and here's what's happening:

- Guides Migration: All guide content will be relocated to visidata/guides/ in VisiData markup format.
- Automated Scripts: We're introducing scripts to:
    - Generate the manpage from guides.
    - Generate the website section /guides/ (or possibly /docs/) from guides.
    - Create /docs/options and /docs/commands references.
    - Submit PRs to edit the guides and incorporate information from GitHub Issues/Docussions (or other activity.

This will consolidate the manpage and /docs into the guides, and will create processes for their ongoing maintenance.

We are going to need your help. The community's contribution is crucial for:

- Writing and refining guides.
- Migrating existing documentation from docs/.md into guides and subsequently deleting old docs.
- Creating instructional videos for various guides.
- Enhancing helpstrings for commands and options, ensuring they are informative and searchable.
- Internationalizing the documentation.
- Producing images, GIFs, and asciicasts to complement the text.

If you want to join us in this exciting journey to make VisiData's documentation a gold standard in the field, keep an eye out for [this followup blogpost](). It will go into all of the details involved in how you can contribute.
