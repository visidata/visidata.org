Hello! My name is Luke Harris, and [I'm a web designer](https://luke.work). I recently completed the new site design for VisiData.org, and wanted to outline the goals and challenges. Let's dive in.

## Goals for the design

* Effectively communicate new releases and blog posts
* Better usability - consistent navigation and structure
* Easier discovery of documentation and features
* Searchable documentation with an easy-to-browse sidebar layout
* Statically generated from existing Markdown files, with templates as needed
* Easy to update and maintain by the VisiData creator and contributors
* RSS feeds for blog posts and releases

## Colophon

This website was originally built with a custom-made static site generator (SSG) and is a mix of regular Markdown files and reStructuredText parsed by [pandoc](https://pandoc.org).

This site is now statically generated with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev), and uses [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for styling.

## Challenges overcome

### reStructured Text

The docs were written in a mix of reStructuredText (RST) and Markdown, which proved a challenge as 11ty does not support RST. 11ty does support HTML files, so Saul wrote a script to run the docs through pandoc and output the resulting HTML files into a directory for 11ty. 

### Documentation search

We needed a quick self-hosted solution to search the documentation, and rely on as few external dependencies as possible. This ruled out popular search engine Algolia, and led me to [lunr.js](https://lunrjs.com), which can be fed a JSON file (generated by 11ty) of the index, and then run the search client-side in the browser. If JavaScript isn't supported in the browser, the search results page falls back to a DuckDuckGo site search link.

### Updatable components

The site features 3 JSON files for easy updating of sections of the site that see frequent updates, including the sponsors in the footer area, the header navigation, and the testimonials.

## Design highlights

### Command demo

This demo existed prior to the redesign on the old site. I gave it a facelift and designed the terminal output area to use a monospaced font. If you select the text, the `$` is left out, allowing for easy copy-and-paste of commands.

### Features and Getting started

Using CSS Grid, I designed a highlighted features area with one block spanning two columns, making for a neat effect.

### Releases and Blog lists on homepage

It's important to quickly be able to catch up on what's new with an open-source project. Adding the blog posts and releases list to the homepage was easily accomplished with 11ty's post collections.
