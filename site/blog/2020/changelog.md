Saul was recently interviewed on [The Changelog](https://changelog.com) podcast!

It also has a [written transcript](https://changelog.com/podcast/394#transcript) available.

This is a very wide-ranging interview. The first quarter covers his discovery of an egregious case of crossword plagiarism. If you want more, you can additionally check out [How A File Format Led To a Crossword Scandal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aHfK8EUIzg), the talk he gave at [csv,conf](https://csvconf.com/2019/speakers/#saul-pwanson) in 2019.

Next, he talked about our collaboration in creating the [biograph framework](http://github.com/devotees/biograph) for our own personal histomaps.

In the second half, he talks about the side-effects of offering VisiData as a gift to the world. Open-sourcing software involves much more than just posting your code to a GitHub repository. There are insecurities, cultural practices, and responsibilities that come with it.

I hope you enjoy the interview! I really did.
