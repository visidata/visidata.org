```
    mv $HOME/.visidata $HOME/.config/visidata
```
- Windows clipboard in WSL
- Windows mouse support
- Add simple .psv (pipe-separated-valuie) loader based on TSV sheet
- Support 2D matrices in NumPy loader
- New commands to add aggregated value and rank columns: `addcol-aggregate` and `addcol-rank-sheet`
- Bind `g-` to `hide-uniform-cols`
- Fix scoring of space-separated search terms in command palette
- Make fuzzy match case-insensitive in command palette
- Add WindowFunctionGuide and AggregatorSheet guides
- Update light theme
- Remove non-precious sheets from sheetlist on statusbar
- Selecting rows on a Freqency Table is now more performant and uses less memory
