## Information we collect

The only information we collect is from website access logs.  This data comes from two sources:

1. Direct access of the website.  When you use a browser to look at a page on the website, each access is logged.

2. VisiData fetching the list of startup messages.  The first time each day that VisiData is used, it downloads a single small file.  This access is also logged by the website.
This network request can be turned off by adding `options.motd_url=''` to your `~/.visidatarc`.

In both cases, we may automatically collect and store certain information in server logs. This may include:

  - IP address
  - User-agent string (Browser or Python version)
  - VisiData version

This website does not use cookies.

## Information we keep

The server logs, which have information about individual website accesses, are kept for 12 months, after which they are deleted.  The aggregated usage information is archived.

## Information we share

We do not share private information with any companies, organizations, or individuals outside of the core development team.

We share aggregated, non-personally identifiable information publicly, to show trends about the general use of VisiData.  This information is posted nightly to [usage.tsv](https://visidata.org/usage.tsv).

## Contact

If you have any questions regarding this Privacy Policy, please contact [vd+privacy@saul.pw](mailto:vd+privacy@saul.pw).

## Changes

Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will post the latest version of our privacy policy on this page.
