## VisiData version 2.0

A lot of features have been added to VisiData.  So many, in fact, that we are calling the next big release v2.0.
But with so many changes, we need your help to test and find bugs.

If you can handle the sharp cutting edge of VisiData, then go ahead and install the latest pre-release version:

    pip3 install git+https://github.com/saulpw/visidata@v2.-4.0

Then, play with the new features and [file any issues](https://github.com/saulpw/visidata/issues/new/choose) you come across.

### New Features (v2.-4)

#### 1. reintegrate deferred mods; save with `z Ctrl+S`

First and foremost, the 'defermods' feature has been reintegrated into core VisiData.
It was added in v2.-1, but it caused some headaches, so we separated it out into a plugin for v2.-2, along with `vls` for the DirSheet.
Then we found that we really missed having the functionality right in vd alongside everything else, and not having to reach for a specialized tool.
@anjakefala got to the bottom of our headaches and did the heavy lifting to make sure that everything works properly now.
So now the DirSheet and SqliteSheets are once again able to 'defer' their modifications and deletions, until saved to the source with `z Ctrl+S`.  `Ctrl+S` saves the sheet to a regular data file as usual.

See also [the defermods page](visidata.org/defermods).

Thanks to @anjakefala for her diligence and hard work on this!

#### 2. unfurl a column (`unfurl-col` bound to `zM`)

As suggested by @jsvine, unfurl is a row-wise expansion of a column with containers.

   - `expand-col` does a column-wise expansion: 1 column is added for each key/value in the containers (assumes mostly homogenous data)
   - `melt` converts non-key columns into rows (on a new melted sheet)
   - `unfurl-col` is kind of like a shortcut for an expand followed by a melt ([demo on twitter](https://twitter.com/VisiData/status/1284956774517182464))

In my mind, `unfurl` is conceptually closer to `expand-col`, but since it pushes a new sheet, putting it on a Shift+ command feels more natural.
The `unfurl-col` command feels like a focused melt--melting lists or dicts in the cursor column, instead of the individual values of the non-key columns as `melt` does.
So it's now bound to `z Shift+M`.

#### 3. 'i'ncrement and family

Generating a range of numbers turns out to be surprisingly handy.

Previously, if you wanted to make a column with a list of numbers, you'd have to use `za` to create a column, `gs` to select all the rows (losing your previous selection) `gz=` (setcol-range
array languages, the 'increment' operator generates a sequence of integers from whole cloth.

In fact there was a version of this in the rownum plugin, and another version in @jsvine's unfurl plugin.
So we added equivalent commands to stock VisiData.
Because of the tradition of using `i`-like characters in APL notation ('ι' in APL and 'i.' in J), and the coincidence
that `i` has remained one of the few unbound keystrokes, I decided to develop this set of increment concepts, and bind them to the `i` family of commands.
See below for the new commands.

#### 4. cli options improved; set sheet-specific options from CLI

We had a couple of open issues with command line options, and finally I bit the bullet and just wrote a custom cmdline args parser, instead of using Python's `argparse`.  It was actually about the same amount of code, but now the syntax is more regular, more permissive, and can set sheet-specific options multiple times and differently for different sheets.
Thanks to @tsibley for patient testing and precise bug reports.

See [/options#cli](/blog/2020/options/) for details on how the command line interface works.

Also the `visidata_dir` option (default `$HOME/.visidata`) can now be set via the environment variable `$VD_DIR`.
Likewise `config` can be set via `$VD_CONFIG`.

#### 5. `fancy_chooser`

Setting the `fancy_chooser` option to True enables a fancy selection menu for adding aggregators and choosing jointypes.
Help text is included for each item; press `Enter` to choose a single item, or select multiple rows and press `g Enter`, or `q` to abort.
This uses the splitpane functionality from the previous release.


#### 6. column format strings

Python has multiple syntaxes for formatting numbers within strings: `%.02f` which used with the `%` format operator, and `{:.02f}` used with .format().
Which should you use for in the `fmtstr` attribute on the Columns sheet?  A [Twitter poll](https://twitter.com/VisiData/status/1182381084433977344) was evenly split, and @tsibley suggested ¿porque no los dos?](https://twitter.com/trs/status/1182390622507827202)
So as of v2.-4, you can use either format mechanism!  If you want thousands separators though, you have to use `{:,.02f}`.  See /blog/fmtstr for details.

#### new and improved loaders

- IMAP (email): open an imap:// url and it'll download all your email, which you can then save to .jsonl like I did
- basic MySQL loader (requires ..; thanks @ )
- basic PDF text extractor (requires pdfminer)

- improved loaders: csv hdf5 html http json jsonl pandas pcap postgres xls yaml

#### new commands

  - `z Shift+M` `unfurl-col`
  - `i` `addcol-range`  adds a column with integer values reflecting the current row order.
  - `gi` `setcol-range`  sets values in the current column for selected rows 
  - `zi` `addcol-range-step` adds a column with values 
  - `gzi` `setcol-range-step` sets values

  - (unbound) `select-error`
  - (unbound) `select-error-col`
  - (unbound) `mouse-enable` and `mouse-disable`


#### lots more improvements and bugfixes

And of course there are tons of bugfixes and smaller improvements throughout.  For a more complete list, see the [CHANGELOG]().

### New Features (v2.-3)

And we are steadily approaching the finish line! With v2.-3 all of the major features that we wanted to be part of v2.0 are complete. Since v2.-2, 16 issues filed by users had code written for them and 6 PRs written by non-maintainers have been merged in. As always, the full summary of changes has been listed in the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/saulpw/visidata/blob/v2.-3/CHANGELOG.md). The large bulk of the changes were improvements in VisiData internals, but a few features definitely stood out.

#### 1. Split screen

It is here! VisiData can now show the two sheets on the Sheets Stack simultaneously.

![gif](/blog/assets/2020-splitwin-screenshot.gif)

- `Shift+Z` splits the screen in half so that the second-most-recently accessed sheet is visible in a second pane.
- `z Shift+Z` splits the screen, and queries for the height of the second pane
- `g Shift+Z` sets the current pane to the whole screen (effectively closing an already split screen)

- `Ctrl+^` swaps which sheet is in the current pane
- `TAB` jumps to the other pane

For more information, check out the [blog post on the feature](/blog/2020/splitwin).

#### 2. json roundtrip

There are some formats (csv, tsv, json, etc) for which VisiData contains both a loader and a saver. A roundtrip is a trait where if a file is loaded, and then immediately saved to the same format, there should be a minimal or no diff. It is important that diffs be informative and only show the actual changes that occurred to the contents of data.

```
vd -b input.json -o output.json
```

Until now, this was not the case with jsons. The columns would get shuffled upon save.

Now, the column order is [preserved upon save](https://github.com/saulpw/visidata/commit/b68819efb599ca12a2bc5fde9a8d3e9052d6db4f). This was a big blocker towards incorporating the the json/jsonl format for internal data sources.

This leads to....

#### 3. add .vdj for cmdlog in jsonl format

If you save the **CommandLog** as .vdj, it will get saved in the .jsonl format. This .vdj can be replayed and loaded, just like a .vd.

Since the jsonl format permits the inclusion of tabs and newlines within cells, this will provide space to these formats to further develop.

### New Features (v2.-2)

Thanks so much to everyone that is helping us prepare for v2.0. This release will feature a [bucketload of bugfixes and additions](https://github.com/saulpw/visidata/blob/v2.-2/CHANGELOG.md) along with the following new features. Between v2.-1 and v2.-2, 26 issues filed by users had code written for them.

#### 1. Every sheet has its own CommandLog

This endeavor was hinted in [this interview](http://visidata.org/podcast/#the-command-log):

```
There is one thing that I do wish that I could solve, and I'm sure that it is solvable, but I haven't managed it yet.
The command log reports every action that you take, including all the dead ends that you wind up finding yourself in.
Those are sometimes handy to have on there, so you can see what you did and didn't want to keep around.
But when you're getting to the end, and you want to do it again, you want to cull all those dead ends out, and just get to the place that you currently are.
And so I want to have some kind of graph or tree that would get you from your current state and only show the commands that you took to get there.
```

and now it is here!

`Shift+D` is now mapped to `cmdlog-sheet`, and takes you to the current sheet's commandlog, with all the other loose ends removed. If missed, `gShift+D` goes to the standard, classic commandlog that contains everything.

#### 2. vls (along with vping and vtop)

It has become apparent that the write-mode of the DirSheet was a conceptually separate tool, even if the interface fits in seamlessly in VisiData. Data sheets and filesystem editing are two radically different use cases.

So from 2.-2 and on, the filesystem manipulation part of VisiData was moved into the entry point **vls**.

To play with, type

```
pip3 install git+git://github.com/saulpw/visidata/vsh@develop
```

and then type `vls`. Please share any feedback [here](https://github.com/saulpw/visidata/issues/361).

(To learn about the write-mode of the DirSheet, check out the following [case study video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prdyXM6-FSc&t=2s).)

The package is called `vsh` because it is going to be a compilation of vd interfaces for Linux utilities.

On top of `vls`, it also includes:

- vping
    - use like regular `ping`
- vtop
    - use like regular `top`

#### 3. Move deferred changes into its own plugin

::::: {.announce}

---
Please note, that there are [two open bugs for defermods](https://github.com/saulpw/visidata/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+%5Bdefermods%5D) at the time of this release. Subscribe to those issues to get updates on when they have been fixed.
---

:::::

Activating this plugin adds two modes to VisiData: Defermods and Trackmods.

Defermods enables modification for sheets that are deferred (e.g. sqlite and vls).
Saving to source is deferred until `commit-sheet` (`Ctrl+S`). Deleted rows and modified cells are colored as pending changes until committed. To save to a different file (not source), use `save-sheet` (`g Ctrl+S`).

Trackmods tracks changes in sheets whose source has a path. Modifications are colored yellow until changes are committed with `commit-sheet` (`Ctrl+S`) or saved with `save-sheet` (`g Ctrl+S`).

These modes are not on by default, `from plugins.defermods import *` must be added to visidatarc (it can also be installed through the **PluginsSheet**. Sheets must set .defermods and/or .trackmods. By default BaseSheet has .defermods=False and .trackmods set to True when defermods is imported.

defermods is not on by default because:
1) deletes with defermods enabled take longer; especially delete-selected
2) it is easier for users to consciously opt-in to a novel VisiData experience than to opt-out

#### 4. Index into sub-sheets from command line

As requested by aborruso! `+:subsheet:col:row` as a command line argument now sets `subsheet` to be the topsheet upon load, with cursor located in cell at `row` and `col`. All of the components are optional. For example, `+:subsheet::` sets the topsheet to be `subsheet` with the cursor located at the top left. `+::col:row` sets the cursor in the cell at `row` and `col` in the topsheet. The toplevel source index can be explicitly named, if there is more than one with `+toplevel:subsheet::`

This currently works for the html, xls, xlsx, xlsb, hdf5, and sqlite loaders.

#### 5. Default startup launches the **vdmenu**

Previously, if a user launched `vd` without a source, the **DirSheet** for the current directory would pop up.

Launching `vd` without a source file, now opens the **vdmenu**, a menu of core sheets. Press `Enter` to open the sheet referenced in the current row.

### New Features (v2.-1)

#### 1. Alt+ layer for easier page-switching.

**Edit: this feature is currently under revision.**

`Alt+1` will go to the first loaded sheet, `Alt+2` goes to the second etc.
A sheet's number is in the lower left of the status line, and in the new `shortcut` column on the **SheetsSheet**.

The Alt (or Esc- prefix) layer is otherwise reserved [for your personal bindings of builtin and/or custom commands](http://visidata.org/docs/customize/).
Use `^[x` as the keybinding for `Alt+x` (or `Esc x`).

#### 2. Undo/redo for modifying commands

By [popular request](https://github.com/saulpw/visidata/issues/141), VisiData now has undo/redo for certain operations.
Press `Shift+U` to undo the last modification on the current sheet, and then `Shift+R` to redo what you just undid.

[In general undo will only be available for commands that could change which data is saved, which means that hiding a column is undoable but changing its width is not.]

**Please let us know if any command is missing an undo, or if there is anything about an undo or redo operation that feels "weird".**

#### 3. Deferred changes

**EDIT: This feature has been moved out of VisiData core and into the plugin: defermods.py. See the list of features in 2.-2 for details.**

When I made the **DirSheet** and gave it the power to delete files, and modify metadata, I quickly realized it needed to be a "deferred sheet".
Modifications and deletions were staged instead of committed immediately.
Then this concept transferred well to vgit, and now it seems like it might be generally useful.

Now, most sheets in VisiData will keep track of their additions/modifications/deletions, and color them accordingly.
You can save the changes back to the source with the usual `Ctrl+S` and revert all changes back to the most recent save with `Ctrl+R`.

**Please let us know how the modify/save/confirm process feels on any sheet, with particular attention to derived sheets and metasheets.**

#### 4. Multi-line rows

Previously, VisiData only had single-line rows; to expand long text you had to increase the width of the column.

Now, VisiData v2.x supports optional multi-line rows! Toggle it by pressing `v` on any sheet with truncated values, and cells in all columns will expand their height and wordwrap to show the full value.

**Please let us know how multi-line rows looks and feels for you; in particular how scrolling with multi-line rows feels.**

#### 5. Range binning for numeric columns on frequency and pivot tables

Per [user request](https://github.com/saulpw/visidata/issues/244), we have added a feature flag for range binning of numeric columns.

If you [set the option](https://github.com/saulpw/visidata/blob/v2.-1/docs/customize.md#how-to-have-setting-configurations-persist) `numeric_binning` to `True`, Freqency and Pivot tables with numeric columns will bin the values into ranges.

**If you play with it, let us know how it feels, and if you find any issues with edge cases.**

#### 6. Plugin framework

Did you know that if you want VisiData to do something new or different, you can write a plugin and start using it right away?  Some plugins have already been written for 1.5.2, like jsvine's [vdnormcol](https://github.com/jsvine/visidata-plugins/blob/master/plugins/vdnormcol.py) and [vddedupe](https://github.com/jsvine/visidata-plugins/blob/master/plugins/vddedupe.py).

2.0 will add a **PluginsSheet**, which fetches the list of known plugins from visidata.org/plugins.tsv, and allows you to easily install and activate (`a`), and/or deactivate (`d`) them. For instructions on how to manually incorporate plugin code, see our [docs](https://github.com/saulpw/visidata/blob/develop/docs/plugins.md) and [dev checklist](https://github.com/saulpw/visidata/blob/develop/dev/checklists/add-plugin.md).

This plugin framework is what makes VisiData a platform, and not just a tool.

The API reworking that we're doing is substantial, so existing plugins and .visidatarc files may need to be changed in a bunch of small ways.
With 2.0, we are going to refine and document a stable and reasonable API for plugin authors to rely on.

And we're doing this work, because the plugin and app ecosystem for VisiData very well might become more important than the VisiData core utility itself.
Like some people use emacs mostly for magit or org-mode, or jupyter and pandas with python.

#### 7. Lots more changes

There are also lots more [changes](https://github.com/saulpw/visidata/blob/v2.-1/CHANGELOG.md)!
Even if you do not end up playing with any of the new features, just using VisiData as you usually do and filing issues as they come would be an enormous help.
